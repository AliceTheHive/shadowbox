After many years of sporadically updating my link:http://lostinopensource.wordpress.com[WordPress Blog] I am archiving it in favor of using link:http://blog.getpelican.com[Pelican].

The control it will give me is amazing. Especially after tying it into a little magic with GitHub sites.

SO I am leaving that site up for posterity, but this is my new testbed for a little while.
