== What's the Plan?

Squeezing 8 servers worth of hardware into something a little bigger than a roller board takes planning. That is what this site is for.

In addition to link:https://trello.com/b/KyamOxNo/shadowbox[Trello], we will use this repository to maintain design schematics, plan upgrades, and talk about the cool ways we figure out to use this piece of hardware.

== Rev1 - The Thanksgiving release

Rev0 came out in mid-October. The next release is planned to be completed and functional by Thanksgiving. Highlights include:

* all 8 nodes functional
* improved networking hardware from the Kingsmill version
* documented processes
* the beginnings of documented procedures
* initial deployment playbooks

So stay tuned, and feel free to help out!
