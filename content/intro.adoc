== What is Shadowbox?

Shadowbox is a new way to think about portable enterprise-grade labs and demonstrations. It is a fully portable (weighs less than 60 pounds), enterprise-grade platform that can run complex solutions-oriented demonstrations and labs.

== What is this Site for?

This site will maintain all of the documentation around the Shadowbox efforts. Material lists, Assembly Notes, and examples of when it's used will all live here. It will also provide a central area to link up all of the various tools that are required to make something this complex work well.
